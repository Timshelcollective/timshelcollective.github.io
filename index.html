              Society has used a mix of stereotypes, sexism and patriarchy to
              keep women away from politics. How often we (women) are asked to
              -- better not venture or deliberate on politics or talk about it
              because, in the estimation of most, if not all, men, "politics is
              not their (women’s) cup of tea". Furthermore, having always been
              looked down upon and admonished for discussing change in the
              drawing-rooms of our house to boardrooms of our organisations,
              this cynicism and hopelessness to be able to do nothing has set
              deep in us, enough to make us forget the power we hold in our
              individual agency. But no more, as individuals we hold the most
              influential power in our vote, wallet and voice and at Timshel our
              vision is to help awaken, strengthen and organise this agency of
              women so we can shape the change we want to see. As they say, if
              not us, then who and everything in this galaxy is made up of tiny
              single units. The smallest is the mightiest.

              Studies show that women take more than 70% of consumption-related
              decisions, be it food, clothing, furniture or cars in families.
              They tend to be in charge of the health of their families and
              continue to be a major influence on both the education and
              activities of family members. Then why not political decisions?
              Across South Asia, women’s parliamentary representation range from
              a meagre 5.8 percent to a paltry 30 percent, still less than the
              minimum 33% equitable balance. Countless examples around the
              world, have demonstrated that feminist leaders and policymakers
              have heralded new ground-breaking work that focuses on benefitting
              the most vulnerable in society. This includes bettering the
              quality and consistency of public service delivery and creating
              more equal and caring societies.

              With each passing day more and more women gaining economic
              freedom, having better access to information, avenues of
              participation and mobilisation itself— is a testament to the fact
              that we are at a tipping point of liberation, a moment we must
              hold onto. Since October 2017, more than 1 million women worldwide
              have shared experiences and solidarity with their sisters under
              the banner of #MeToo platforms. In 2017, the #LahuKaLagaan hashtag
              took over on Twitter to campaign against the 12 percent tax on
              sanitary napkins, with the “period tax” being scrapped in 2018 as
              a result of the movement. Pertinently Women are collectivising
              under common banners of solidarity and finding new ways to amplify
              their voice, vote and wallet.
